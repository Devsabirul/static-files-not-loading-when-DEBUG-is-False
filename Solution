if i run my project in python manage.py runserver --insecure . By this i got my static as well.

Solution 1:

python manage.py runserver --insecure
Solution 2:

But I Need Permanent Solution. then i install pip install dj-static==0.0.6 and add some code to my wsgi.py file:

from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
from dj_static import Cling

application = Cling(get_wsgi_application())
and then i added some in setting.py:

STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '/static/')
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / "static",
]

after run server just run:python manage.py collectstatic
after finished collecstatic run : python manage.py runserver
